Hello, I'm Coco, a recent graduate from BENG in Electronic and Information Engineering in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

I'm currently working on a role of associate software engineer to development SCADA system for railway system.
Here's the key techniques that are using:
1. MySQL
2. Python
3. Javascript (Node.js, Angular.js)
4. Tomcat
5. Microservices
6. CI/CD: GIT, Jenkins
7. LINUX

I'm currently learning Natural Language Processing to build a chatbot and I want to record what I have learnt. Therefore, I created a blog in there.
